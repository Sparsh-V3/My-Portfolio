        I am a passionate full-stack web developer with a strong focus on React,
        Node.js, and modern web technologies. My journey into web development
        started with a deep curiosity about how websites and applications work
        behind the scenes. Over time, I have honed my skills in frontend and
        backend development, enabling me to build interactive, responsive, and
        high-performing web applications.

      <p>
        I believe in writing clean, efficient, and reusable code, following a
        component-driven approach in React to enhance maintainability. Whether
        itâ€™s designing smooth user interfaces, implementing authentication
        systems, or optimizing API performance, I always strive to create
        solutions that are both user-friendly and scalable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I am deeply invested in continuous learning and
        open-source contributions. I enjoy exploring new technologies,
        contributing to projects, and collaborating with like-minded developers.
        My problem-solving mindset allows me to tackle complex challenges, and I
        am always eager to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and
        system design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am working on projects that strengthen my expertise in
        React, Redux, Express.js, and database management. I am also exploring
        best practices for scalable architecture and modern UI/UX trends to
        deliver engaging digital experiences. My goal is to build applications
        that not only function flawlessly but also create a lasting impact.
